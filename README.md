## Welcome to My php login website!

A clean template to integrate into your website for an easy php login! NOTE: this is being worked on, I am not responsible for any hackers that got through the security, be sure to secure the website enough before actually bringing it online, security will get better over time, have fun with it!

## Setup:
1. Install wamp server.
2. Run the SQL code in the database file.
3. Change names to your liking, if you change names be sure to change them in the code.
4. Everything for the database connection is in the php/dbconnect file, be sure to configure those settings
5. And you're done!
